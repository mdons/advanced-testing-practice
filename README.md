Testing Practice

create folders for the containers
containers need to be tested with redux and store because that is the only point of a container

test components?? -  NO
the only thing you would test in a component is internal state, hide/show, 
how do you bring 2 components together?


### Calculations
* Implement the calculation functions

### Function
* Implement the code for the functions as described in the comments

### Add Calculation Tests
* Implement calculation tests that make sense

### Add Function Tests
* Implement the tests as described in the comments

### User Button Tests
* Create a folder for UserButtonContainer in containers
* Move UserButtonsContainer.js into this folder and rename it index
* Fix import paths
* Add a file UserButtonsContainer.tests.js
    * Import UserButtonsContainer into the test
    * Import store into the test
    * create a variable called “wrapper”
    * in beforeAll, mount the Provider and UserButtonsContainer and assign to wrapper
    * Create a describe “Add User Button”
        * Create an it “should increase users array length by 1”
        * Use the wrapper to find the first button
        * Simulate a click on the button
        * use store.getState() to check the length of the users array
        * expect it toBe 1 more than the current length
    * Create a describe “Remove User Button”
        * Create an it “should decrease users array length by 1”
        * Use the wrapper to find the second button
        * Simulate a click on the button
        * use store.getState() to check the length of the users array
        * expect it toBe 1 less than the current length

### User Display Tests
* Create a folder for UserContainer in containers
* Create a file for UserContainer.test.js
* describe “UserContainer”
* it “should render an li for each user”
* mount Provider and SpecialTextContainer into wrapper
* use the store to dispatch a “ADD_USER” action with the value of a user object
* `expect(wrapper.find(“li”)).to.have.length(8);`

### Hopefully at this point we can see there is a pattern to making the tests

### ChangeTemperatureContainer.js
* Create a test file for this container to ensure that when the text box changes, the state currentTemp changes 

### CityDropDownContainer.js
* Create a test file to ensure that when the drop down changes, the state currentCity changes

### CurrentCityContainer.js
* Create a test file to ensure that when the state currentCity is change, the text of the div changes to “CurrentCity: whatever city”
